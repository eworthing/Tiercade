# Tier Creator Focus Fix - Phase 2 (CORRECT SOLUTION)

## Root Cause Analysis

After Phase 1 fixes failed to resolve navigation issues, deep analysis of Apple's `focusSection()` documentation revealed the **true purpose** of the API:

> "By declaring the VStack that encloses buttons 'A' - 'C' as a focus section, the VStack can receive focus, and deliver that focus to its first focusable child"

### The Key Insight

`focusSection()` is **REQUIRED** for spatially separated UI regions to be reachable from each other. The Apple example shows two button groups (upper-left vs bottom-right) where swiping right from the left group reaches the right group ONLY because `.focusSection()` is applied.

### What We Did Wrong in Phase 1

We removed **ALL** `focusSection()` calls based on misunderstanding "use sparingly". This broke focus navigation because:

1. **Header toolbar** became unreachable from stage content (spatially distant)
2. **Footer actions** became unreachable from stage content (spatially distant)
3. **Right panels in HStack** became unreachable from left panels (spatially distant)

### Correct Usage Pattern

`focusSection()` should be used for:
- **Spatially separated interactive regions** (header, footer, sidebars)
- **Right panels in HStack layouts** (enables left-to-right navigation)
- **NOT needed** within homogeneous content areas (like button groups in same container)

This matches the working MainAppView pattern which has `.focusSection()` on:
- Top toolbar (line 566 of MainAppView.swift)
- Detail sidebar overlay (line 223)
- Multiple overlay panels

## Phase 2 Implementation

### Changes Made

#### 1. TierCreatorView.swift
```swift
TierCreatorHeaderToolbar(...)
    #if os(tvOS)
    .focusSection()  // ← Added: Makes header reachable from stage content
    #endif

TierCreatorFooterActions(...)
    #if os(tvOS)
    .focusSection()  // ← Added: Makes footer reachable from stage content
    #endif
```

**Rationale:** Header and footer are spatially distant from stage content. Without `focusSection()`, focus gets trapped in the middle content area and can't reach toolbar buttons or footer navigation buttons.

#### 2. TierCreatorSetupStageView.swift
```swift
HStack {
    detailCard  // Left panel

    sidebar     // Right panel
        #if os(tvOS)
        .focusSection()  // ← Added: Enables left-to-right navigation
        #endif
}
```

**Rationale:** Matches Apple's example where right VStack needs `focusSection()` to receive focus from left buttons. Enables swiping right from detailCard fields to reach sidebar content.

#### 3. TierCreatorItemsStageView.swift
```swift
HStack {
    library     // Left panel (item grid)

    inspector   // Right panel
        #if os(tvOS)
        .focusSection()  // ← Added: Enables left-to-right navigation
        #endif
}
```

**Rationale:** Same pattern - right inspector panel needs to be reachable from left library grid.

#### 4. TierCreatorStructureStageView.swift
```swift
HStack {
    TierCreatorStageCard("Arrange tiers") { ... }  // Left rail

    TierCreatorStageCard("Live preview") { ... }   // Right preview
        #if os(tvOS)
        .focusSection()  // ← Added: Enables left-to-right navigation
        #endif
}
```

**Rationale:** Right preview panel needs to be reachable from left tier rail.

### What We Kept from Phase 1

✅ `.borderless` button style - correct for tvOS
✅ `focusScope()` on stage content - correct for limiting default focus
✅ Removed redundant `focusable(true)` on buttons - buttons are focusable by default
✅ Removed manual `resetFocus` calls - system handles focus correctly

### What We Fixed from Phase 1

❌ Removed ALL `focusSection()` → ✅ Added back selectively at structural boundaries
❌ Isolated header/footer from content → ✅ Made them reachable with `focusSection()`
❌ Broke HStack left-right navigation → ✅ Enabled with `focusSection()` on right panels

## Validation

### Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Header reachable:** Swiping up from stage content reaches toolbar buttons
2. **Footer reachable:** Swiping down from stage content reaches action buttons
3. **Sidebar navigation:** Swiping right from left panels reaches right panels
4. **No trapping:** Focus never gets stuck in any single region
5. **System behavior:** All standard SwiftUI focus animations and effects work

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Build succeeds for tvOS target
- [ ] Launch in Apple TV 4K 3rd gen simulator (tvOS 26)
- [ ] Navigate to Tier Creator
- [ ] Test header buttons reachable from content
- [ ] Test footer buttons reachable from content
- [ ] Test Setup stage: left ↔ right panel navigation
- [ ] Test Items stage: library ↔ inspector navigation
- [ ] Test Structure stage: rail ↔ preview navigation
- [ ] Verify no focus trapping in any region
- [ ] Confirm Exit command (Menu button) dismisses correctly

   - Original reference showing sidebar needing `focusSection()`
   - Pattern we now correctly apply to our right panels

### Working Code Patterns in Tiercade

- `MainAppView.swift` line 566: Toolbar with `.focusSection()`
- `MainAppView.swift` line 223: Detail sidebar with `.focusSection()`
- `DetailView.swift` line 122: Uses `.focusSection()` for sidebar
- `AnalyticsSidebarView.swift` line 44: Uses `.focusSection()` for side panel
- `QuickMoveOverlay.swift` line 90: Uses `.focusSection()` for overlay

All working overlays and panels use this pattern - we were missing it in Tier Creator.

## Lessons Learned

### Correct Interpretation of "Use Sparingly"

Apple's guidance to "use `focusSection()` sparingly" means:
- ✅ **DO use** at major structural boundaries (header, footer, panels)
- ❌ **DON'T use** within every small container or button group
- ✅ **DO use** when spatial distance requires explicit focus bridging
- ❌ **DON'T use** when SwiftUI's default focus navigation already works

### Focus Management Philosophy

SwiftUI's focus system is smart enough to navigate within contiguous UI regions automatically. We only need `focusSection()` when:
1. Regions are spatially distant (header at top, content in middle, footer at bottom)
2. Regions are in different panel columns (left vs right in HStack)
3. Standard directional navigation wouldn't naturally discover the target region

### Development Process Improvement

For future focus issues:
1. ✅ Search Apple docs for specific API usage patterns
2. ✅ Examine working code in same codebase first
3. ✅ Test hypotheses before implementing across multiple files
4. ✅ Understand WHY the pattern exists, not just copy-paste
5. ⚠️ Don't assume "simplify" means "remove everything"

## Next Steps

1. **Build and deploy** to tvOS simulator
2. **Manual testing** of all navigation paths
3. **Verify** no regressions in other parts of the app
4. **Document** any remaining focus issues (if any)
5. **Update** TIER_CREATOR_FOCUS_AUDIT.md with Phase 2 findings
