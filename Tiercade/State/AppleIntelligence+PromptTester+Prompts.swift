    You are a language model. You have an architectural limitation: when generating long lists, you can "forget" \

    To compensate for this, you MUST follow this strict, chunked generation algorithm:

    1. Generate items 1 through 5.
    2. PAUSE. Re-read items 1-5 to refresh your memory.
    3. Generate items 6 through 10, checking against 1-5.
